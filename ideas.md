# Ideas
1. Add slider to change how many beats each song gets before changing songs
2. Poll for people to rate how good different mashups are
3. Segment songs by different parts, and only mashup parts of the songs that don't contain vocals (since vocal mashups don't work well)
4. Button for "Add to my playlist"
5. Sync up "high" beatpoints in the song.  Match levels in the songs so that they both hit the high points at the same time.
6. Mash the similar parts of songs together (i.e. chorus w/ chorus, verse 1 w/ verse 1) and then string those together
7. Option to mash more than two songs together
